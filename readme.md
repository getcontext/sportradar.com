Hello,

Hope you are well.

I have implemented TDD first approach and followed TDD principle.
So, firstly Unit Tests are implemented with JUnit.

Then after implementing tests, I've implemented/generated classes,interfaces and methods.

There are Team, Match, Scoreboard and Main classes.
Main class, have main() java method and is runner, which You can run and test exercise.

There are extracted abstract class for scoreboard and interface for match.
It is used ConcurrentHashMap to store matches, so each scoreboard is thread safe.

I planned to add factory/factories and use factory pattern for Match and Team creation.
Also to add generics.

If you have any questions, please ask me.

Thank you, kind regards.
